Different Python projects:

Each project includes the necessary documentation for understanding. 

Each project is located in a separate subfolder, which contains all the necessary data, information, and functions required for that project. 

List of Projects:

(1) Gym analysis: You are a product manager for a fitness studio and are interested in understanding the current demand for digital fitness classes. You plan to conduct a market analysis in Python to gauge demand and identify potential areas for growth of digital products and services.

(2) Register_funcs: You are a junior developer working in a small start-up. Your managers have asked you to develop a new account registration system for a mobile app. The system must validate user input on the sign-up form before creating an account.

(3) Simple GLM: Insurance companies invest a lot of time and money into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim. In many countries, having car insurance is a legal requirement to drive a vehicle on public roads, making the market very large.

(4) time_funcs: You recently quit your job to start a space logistics company that uses rockets to deliver critical cargo to colonies on demand. Since you're still in the startup phase, you're handling everything yourself, including writing the software to manage complex scheduling and timing across different space colonies.

(5) mannwhitneyu_test: You create two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match since the 19th century, which you scraped from a reliable online source. This data is stored in two CSV files: women_results.csv and men_results.csv.

The question you are trying to determine the answer to is:

Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than in men's?
